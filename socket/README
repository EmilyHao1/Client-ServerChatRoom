CS513 Computer Network Final Project
Client-Server Chat Program
Emily Hao

To Run the program, first run the ServerChat jar by directing to that folder, and run
$java -jar socket.jar.

Then run the MultiClientChat jar by directing to that folder, and run .
$java -jar client.jar.

Note that I used Intellij, which allows parallel run, so I can run MultiClientChat multiple times for testing.

You should be able to run the client jar file as many times as you want, you do need to open a new terminal window for
each run. If somehow you cannot run the file mutilple times, simply dumplicated the jar file a couple times,
you don't need to change any code, just run the different jar files.

Once you run the MultiClientChat, you should see a window asking you to pick a nickname. Once you picked a name, you
enter the chat, please note the format of the message you can send, else it won't display:
To Broadcast, type
@ALL#<Messgae>

To whisper to specific client
@<Client>#<Message>

@ and # are the signals I used for parsing, so it is important to use this format. After you are done typing your
massage, simply hit enter to send.
If you are recieving a message, your window would shake as a notification.

Once you are done with the chat, you can close the chat window.
